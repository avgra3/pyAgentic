# pyAgentic

A toy agentic model that uses _gemini-2.0-flash-001_ to run. This supports the following:

- cli commands to get you started
- limited to the scope of a single directory and its children
- prints responses from the LLM similar to other agentic models (although fairly rudimentary)


_This project is to be a sample of using LLM to create an agent. As such, it is not worthy of production use and may be prone to errors or security issues._
